# C Programming Dumps

- This repository will serve as my archive for old C programming files. This includes topics from Programming I, II, and Data Structures and Algorithms.

- The source files of this repository was made with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as the main text editor. Make the necessary changes if you use varying IDEs. It is recommended to use <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/dev-cpp">Dev-C++</a> for this case.

- **DISCLAIMER: This will not serve as an "answer code" repository**

- **NOTE: If the `.gitignore` file is not included in your clone of this repo, please follow the code I wrote for it here!** 

## Topics I dump here:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (Ongoing)**
- Structures
- Linked-List and Variations
- Arrays ADT List and their Versions **(Some are missing)**

## DSA Topics that I am still working on...

- Functions for ADT such as `insert` `delete` `search` `isMember`
- Cursor-based Implementations
- Bitwise, Bitvector, Hash Table, UID with Unsorted Sets
